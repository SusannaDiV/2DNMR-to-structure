# README

This repository contains scripts for dataset preparation and model training as described in the paper: *Leveraging Pre-Trained LMs for Rapid and Accurate Structure Elucidation from 2D NMR Data*. The models in this repository utilize pre-trained T5 models to predict SMILES strings from 2D NMR spectra and molecular structure. Please ensure SMILES string validity before preprocessing.

## Prerequisites

All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can installall dependencies using:

pip install -r requireemnts.txt

Dataset Preparation
1. Categorize SMILES strings
Categorizes your SMILES accordingly to their complexity. The paper results where achieved by keeping SMILES from 'Very Easy' to 'Moderate' difficulty from the cite3d datasets.

python categorize_smiles.py /path/to/input_file /path/to/output_file
/path/to/input_file: Path to the input file containing raw SMILES strings.
/path/to/output_file: Path to save the categorized SMILES strings.

2. Find Isomers
You can use the find_isomers.py script to identify and quantify potential isomers in your dataset:

python find_isomers.py /path/to/smiles_file.csv
/path/to/smiles_file.csv: Path to the CSV file containing SMILES strings.

Training the Models
Both models take in input a list of molecular formula + list of (x, y, intenisty) 2D NMR spectra separated by Â¦ alongside a file containing the SMILES strings as the target output:

python sequential_model.py --train_src "path/to/train_nmr.src" --train_tgt "path/to/train_smiles.tgt" --test_src "path/to/test_nmr.src" --test_tgt "path/to/test_smiles.tgt" --output_dir "./save_model_directory"
train_src: Path to the training NMR spectra file.
train_tgt: Path to the training SMILES file.
test_src: Path to the testing NMR spectra file.
test_tgt: Path to the testing SMILES file.
output_dir: Directory to save the trained model and results.

python conditioned_model.py --train_src "path/to/train_nmr.src" --train_tgt "path/to/train_smiles.tgt" --test_src "path/to/test_nmr.src" --test_tgt "path/to/test_smiles.tgt" --output_dir "./save_model_directory"
train_src: Path to the training NMR spectra file.
train_tgt: Path to the training SMILES file.
test_src: Path to the testing NMR spectra file.
test_tgt: Path to the testing SMILES file.
output_dir: Directory to save the trained model and results.
Both models will output results to the specified directory, including training logs, model checkpoints, and evaluation results.

Ensure that your NMR data and SMILES files are correctly formatted.
